import UIKit

/*

our app files exist in sandbox
we can only store our content in the spot iOS gives us access to

it's more than just what XCode gives us when create projectâ€”-all of that goes under App/YourApp.app

there's other stuff in App folder--some of it we can mess with a little, some not

Today, we'll be working with Temporary folder and Documents folder


Core Data is an awesome thing iOS has set up so we don't have to work directly with Sequel
